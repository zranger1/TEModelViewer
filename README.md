### TEModelViewer 
For 2024, Titanic's End is capable of outputting an NDI stream of pixel data. as it appears on the car. TEModelViewer is a Processing (4.x) sketch that allows you to decode this stream and view it on a point cloud model of Titanic's End.

Don't take this seriously as the last word in how to this data ought to be rendered. It's a quickly assembled proof-of-concept for the use of TE's Chromatik application and controls as a source for projection, for use at live events where it's not practical
to bring the entire gigantic art car. 

(This sketch uses a custom build of [Devolay](https://github.com/walkerKnapp/Devolay) to receive NDI video.  Far as I know, (as of Feb 2024), it is the only existing build that supports Apple Silcon Macs, as well as Linux and Windows.  x86 Macs
should work too, but I am currently unable to test.)
